This is the repository where everything our group has completed over the semester is housed. The JSON and XML files associated with our Thunkable app are in the src/ThunkableApp
directory. We have a website which serves as user level documentation for our app in the docs folder. We also have developer documentation in the Wiki section where
devlopers that want to understand how we built our app can go.

# Instructions for Downloading
Due to an error with Thunkable we were unable to upload the final version of our app to the Google Play Store. However, we have an old version of our app that
is available for internal testers only. The link to download the app is [here](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4701642006021837737). Simply go to that app and
download the app to your Android device.
