# Instructions for Downloading
Due to an error with Thunkable we were unable to upload the final version of our app to the Google Play Store. However, we have an old version of our app that
is available for internal testers only. The link to download the app is [here](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4701642006021837737). Simply go to that app and
download the app to your Android device.
