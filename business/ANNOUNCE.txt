We are thrilled to announce the start of an exciting new App which will revolutionize the organization and communications within clubs, groups, and teams of all 
sorts: EverythingClub!  With this new software, a group will have the opportunity to discuss on open forums, post and view on communal announcement boards, and 
communicate directly with individual group members through a direct messaging system, all within the local community of the group.  For the leaders and financial 
managers of the groups, there will be special privileges and features including but not limited to financial storage, management, or payment, as well as 
information regarding individual activity within the group, as well as administrative capabilities over the open forum and announcement board.  EverythingClub 
consolidates all the niche features of the group management app market into one user-friendly experience!
