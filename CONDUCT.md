# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
Scrum Master: brandt_ogden@uri.edu, Owner: vfaywofle@uri.edu.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### Decision
Before any major decision there has to be a discussion between all team members. If we can't 
come to a consensus there will be a vote where majority rules.

## Team Rules

### Attendance
It is expected that all team members show up to every class meeting unless there is a valid reason 
for the abscence. Valid reasons but are not limited to sickness and emergencies. It should be 
made clear to the group that you will be missing the meeting and it's your responsibility to 
make up any work you missed. Repeated violations will be reported to Professor Fay-Wolfe.

### Assignments
The Scrum Master will communicate with devlopers about the due dates for assignments and the
team will work collaboratively to meet the deadline. Any missing, incomplete, or bad work will
be subject to review by the entire group. If the group comes to the decision that it was unsatisfactory,
the person who's work it was will be responsible for completing it.

### Participation
During our daily SCRUM meetings we will have an open discussion where every group member will say what they
are working on and what they need help with. We will ensure that everyone gets a voice.

### Meeting Times / Location
We will attend all class and project section meetings. If the group determines that additional meetings will
be necesary the group will come to a decision on a location and time.

### Agenda / Meeting Notes
Each member of the group will be responsible for taking their own notes. In the event that a member misses
a meeting someone will send that person the meeting notes.

### Promptness
Each member is expected to show up on time. Any tardiness will be dealt with on a case by case basis
by a discussion of the group.

### Conversational Courtesies
Each member is expected to be respectful of others and allow everyone their turn to talk. In the event
there is a violation it will be a discussion by the group to dicuss repurcussions.

### Enforcement / Feedback
Any problems that occurr should be brought up at the daily SCRUM meetings, and will result in a 
discussion by the group.

### Signatures
We hereby acknowledge that we will follow this code of conduct.
