Bulleted List of Metrics for Each Person  
1. Net Promoter Score (Sam) 
2. Daily Active Users (James)
3. Churn Rate (Jackson): When a user completes the signup process, a Thunkable observer block in the Login Screen would fire, sending a signal to Firebase with the current date/time. Firebase would update the relevant database backend with the new data point, which will be made available with others in the next Google Analytics report upon request. A possible graph representing these data points might be a line graph, where the data is categorized into hours or days. The graph would show the number of new signups, not total signups.
4. Number of Downloads (Henry)
5. Time on App Per Day (Brandt)
